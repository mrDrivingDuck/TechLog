### PLC

Wikipedia:

> A __programmable logic controller__ (__PLC__) or __programmable controller__ is an industrial digital computer which has been ruggedized and adapted for the control of manufacturing processes, such as assembly lines, or robotic devices, or any activity that requires high reliability control and ease of programming and process fault diagnosis.

Basically, PLC is a small computer used in industry:

* Inputs - generated by __buttons__ & __sensors__
* Outputs - control __motors__

Imagine PLC as a:

* Raspberry Pi
* Arduino
* Beagle Bone Black
* ...
* a similar embedded board with inputs & outputs

PLC is specifically prepared for use in __industry__

* can be acquired from many different manufacturers
* efficiently produced for narrowed purposes

PLC manufacturer develops:

* Hardware
* Basic software (firmware) - comparable to OS of normal computers
* IDE - for programing PLCs on normal computers and uploading it to the PLCs

### Programing PLCs

Each PLC vendor offers a specific IDE

The programming languages for PLCs were standardized in __IEC 61131-3__:

| Programming Language            | Form        |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Ladder Diagram (LD)             | Graphical   |
| Function Block Diagram (FBD)    | Graphical   |
| Structured Text (ST)            | Textual     |
| Instruction List (IL)           | ~~Textual~~ |
| Sequential Function Chart (SFC) | Graphical   |

Take FBD as an example:

![iec-61131-fbd](../img/iec-61131-fbd.png)

* Type - `TON`、`AND`、`RS`
* Function Block (FB) Instance - `on_delay1`、`alarm`
  * individual internal state
  * can be considered as a __function__
* Inputs - on the left side
* Outputs - on the right side

### Run

After programming/drawing in IDE

Compile & Upload to PLC

Inputs & Outputs can be connected to the real sensors & motors
